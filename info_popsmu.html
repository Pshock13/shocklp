            <p class="hangIndent">POPS Master User started as a way to scan the check in locations on-screen by displaying a barcode based on where you needed to place an item. Initially a volatile add-on only intended for problem solve leads due to the ability to misuse the add-on (possible to scan a check-in location and forget where you scanned). POPS MU now has a history listing of locations scanned as well as a few other treats.</p>

                        <u>Barcode Generator</u>: There are a few situations where POPS MU will generate a barcode.
                        <ol>
                            <li>When a loose items goes to overage, select a number to generate the overage bin of your choosing.

                            </li>
                            <li>When checking in items, you will either be presented with letters representing the letters of the chutes and then an input field asking for a number to generate the chute to start placing a shipment in. Or if the shipment already has a chute, you will be presented with the barcode for that chute.
                                
                            </li>
                            <li>You can also generate a barcode for the PS totes from packers when selcting "scan from tote or SP00" allowing you to check items in directly from the totes without needing to collect them.

                        <u>History List</u>: This list is off to the left side to keep track of the barcodes that have been generated. A history of 5 unique barcodes is kept at any given time. If the same barcode is generated more than once in succession, a number will appear next to the barcode in parenthesis. Each of the barcodes in the list is also a link to FCResearch for that specific barcode.
