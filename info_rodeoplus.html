                    <p class="hangIndent">Rodeo Plus started out as a plug-in called 'Bypass Hitch' as it had just one simple task, avoid going to Hitch Tool which at that time had been depricated though links to the tool still survived. The task of this plug-in at the time was to take links that would send you to Hitch Tool and reroute them to OOPS Tool (for ShipIDs) or to FCResearch (for ASINs and locations). Since it's inception, OOPS Tool has also been depricated in favor of the POPS Tool. Now ShipIDs will open a new rodeo tab that show the items needed for that shipment.</p>
                    <h4>Functions:</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>ShipIDs</u>: Links open a new window to rodeo showing all items for that shipmnet.</li>
                            <li><u>ASINs, locations, sp00s</u>: These links will open as a search in FCResearch.</li>
                            <li><u>Copy Clipboard</u>: Next to shipIDs will be an invisible clipboard that shows up when hovered. Pressing it will copy the shipID and trim the white space (an issue that was presented when pasting IDs in chat or pslipUI.)<br>

                                <u>CPT highlighter</u>: Highlight the cell of the expected ship date when the shipment is a CPT.<br>
                                <span class="redCpt">&nbsp;red </span> for shipments due out within 1.5hrs from expected ship date (roughly 1 hour from PAD time) and <span class = "yellowCpt">yellow</span> for shipments due out in the next 2.5hrs.<br>

                            <li>
                                <u>Condition Tooltip</u>: Hovering over a cell in the 'condition' column will show a tooltip with a short description.<br>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="media/conditionTooltip.png" class="screenshot"/>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Gift Wrap Icon</u>: Cells with any condition pertaining to gift wrap shipments will have a little gift icon next to the condition.<br>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="media/gwIcon.png" class="screenshot"/>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Tote Checker</u>: Sometimes when totes are scanned, they don't scan all the characters in the barcode or they capitalize letters that shouldn't be capitalized. When this happens, the physical tote may get lost if the sorter scans the tote correctly when a picker didn't. This add-on will have a tooltip on-hover as well as highlight these 'bad scan' totes with a red blinking animation so that they can be recognized and dealt with sooner rather than later.<br>

                    <p>Rodeo Plus will continue to have new functionality added to it. A few things currently in the works:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <u>Pop-up FCResearch</u>: Instead of opening a new tab to see the item when clicking on the ASIN, there will be a pop-up of some sort to show the item image and maybe some other key information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>ASIN title on hover</u>: Currently there is a rodeo option to have a column to display the title of the ASIN. This takes up width on screen and truncates the title to the width of the cell. I'd like to have the ASIN title show up under the cursor when you hover ofver the ASIN.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

<div id="changelog">
    <span class="version">* 1.0.x *</span><br>
